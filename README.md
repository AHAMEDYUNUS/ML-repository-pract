# pneumonia  prediction using data set containing X-Ray images

This project is to predict the pneumonia in the dataset, that the dataset contains the images of normal  x-rays and pneumonia affected x-rays.
This prediction is done by  neural networks(CNN)
Here we using expert Imagenet models such as VGG16, VGG19, RESNET50, DENSENET121 for fitting with dataset



**step 1** : Download or clone this repo
>git clone https://github.com/AHAMEDYUNUS/Pneumonia-prdeiction-using-X-Ray-images.git

**step 2** : open the code file with jupyter notebook.

**step 3** : Run the initial code to setup environment and to download dataset

**step 4** : Splitting  dataset into training and testing set.

**step 5** : Selecting a model(VGG16, VGG19, DENSENET121, RESNET50) and train it with training dataset.

**step 6** : Evaluate the trained model with test data.

**step**   : Make conclusions on predictions made by those models.
